# Portaled
Client-Side Content Driver for the Asheron's Call MMORPG

This project is in a VERY EARLY phase. The code will not look nice, and you may have a hard time getting it to work without some technical knowledge. The project is in need of volunteers who want to help expand and improve the capabilities.

We will be able to change or add new textures, sounds, models, buildings, dungeons, and skills to the game, all without requiring the player to modify any DAT file. Only a Decal plugin will be required. And the dependency on Decal itself is extremely light still, as all of the Hooks are done without the help of Decal, so it may not even require Decal eventually.
